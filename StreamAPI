Stream API
========================================
Introduced in Java 8, the Stream API is used to process collections of objects
A stream is a sequence of objects that supports various methods which can be pipelined to produce the desired result.

The features of Java stream are –

1 A stream is not a data structure instead it takes input from the Collections, Arrays or I/O channels.
2 Streams don’t change the original data structure, they only provide the result as per the pipelined methods.
3 Each intermediate operation is lazily executed and returns a stream as a result, hence various intermediate operations can be pipelined.
  Terminal operations mark the end of the stream and return the result.
